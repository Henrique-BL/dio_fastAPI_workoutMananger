# üöÄ FastAPI Project

This project combines Postgresql database and FastAPI to create a API that records the workout place and category of a athlete.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Main Frameworks and Tools

- **FastAPI** (`fastapi==0.111.0`): ![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?logo=fastapi&logoColor=white)  
  A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ 
- **SQLAlchemy** (`SQLAlchemy==2.0.30`): ![SQLAlchemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLAlchemy-000000?logo=python&logoColor=white)  
  An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Python that facilitates communication between Python classes and relational databases.
- **Alembic** (`alembic==1.13.1`): ![Alembic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alembic-0078D4?logo=python&logoColor=white)  
  A database migration tool used alongside SQLAlchemy.

### Asynchronous Support and Communication

  A fast, lightweight ASGI server to serve ASGI applications.

### Validation and Configuration

- **Pydantic** (`pydantic==2.7.1`): ![Pydantic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pydantic-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)  
  Used for data validation and settings management using Python.
- **pydantic-settings** (`pydantic-settings==2.2.1`): ![pydantic-settings](https://img.shields.io/badge/pydantic--settings-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)  
  An extension of Pydantic to manage application settings.

### Utilities

- **python-dotenv** (`python-dotenv==1.0.1`): ![python-dotenv](https://img.shields.io/badge/python--dotenv-3670A0?logo=python&logoColor=white)  
  To load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **PyYAML** (`PyYAML==6.0.1`): ![PyYAML](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyYAML-023430?logo=yaml&logoColor=white)  
  For working with YAML files.

## üìÑ Description

This project is designed to leverage FastAPI's capabilities to create a scalable and high-performance API. It incorporates a suite of tools to manage database migrations, asynchronous operations, and configuration management efficiently.

## ‚ú® Main Features

- High-performance API development with FastAPI
- Robust database interactions using SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- Asynchronous database access with asyncpg
- Comprehensive data validation and settings management using Pydantic
- Environment variable management with python-dotenv
- PUT, GET, POST, PATCH http methods

## üöÄ How to Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    cd <YOUR_PATH>
    git clone https://github.com/Henrique-BL/dio_fastAPI_workoutMananger
  
    ```


2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the necessary variables.

4. **Run database migrations:**
  
   This will run all created migrations and update the database

    ```bash
      make run-migrations 
    ```
    This will create a migration, it's useful after you've done some change to the project that has to do with the database.

      ```bash
        make create-migration
      ```

5. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
      make run
    ```
## ! Notes !
If you're using Linux or MacOS, change the Makefile commands to be compatible with your OS.

## üìö How to Use

1. **Access the API documentation:**
   Once the server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to view the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI.

2. **Interact with the API:**
   Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) to send requests to the endpoints defined in the API.

3. **Monitor logs and debug:**
   Use the terminal output and integrated logging to monitor the server's activity and debug any issues.
